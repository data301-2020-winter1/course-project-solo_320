## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

For this data analytics project I hope to use the dataset I have chosen in order to generate valuable information that allows us to discern the wine with the best quality in terms of red and white individually as well as be able to look at the two comparatively. I am interested in this topic because as a management student, marketing is an avenue that I am interested in and I imagine that if I manage to complete the tasks in this project well I will gain skills that are transferrable if I choose to pursue a career in marketing.
In terms of questions that I would like to explore, some potentially include:
- What density do the best quality wines have?
- What is the average quality of the red wine samples?
- What is the maximum and minimum PH’s of both the wines?
It should be possible to create a dashboard with the data I have by displaying summary statistics like mean, count, max, min etc. It would also be possible to create charts such as bar charts, line graphs and scatter plots that show comparative data between and within the two types of wines.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

For the project I have chosen the wine quality data set from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. The data contains results from physicochemical tests and outputs from sensory variables that allow us to model wine quality. There are *two separate data sets* for vinho verde’s red and white variants from the Minho region of Portugal. The data was collected from May 2004 to February 2007 where samples were tested by a certified entity (*CVRVV – an inter-professional organization with the goal of improving the quality and marketing of vinho verde*) and the resulting data recorded in a computerized system which automatically manages the wine sample testing process. This data can be used in the study of wine to understand which wines could possibly be improved on or perhaps changed altogether. It can also be used in a business setting like target marketing where the data may be used to discern consumer preferences in order to build a custom marketing plan.
