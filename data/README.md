#### All data will be stored in this directory.

- This folder currently has two subdirectories:
    1. processed - This will store any datasets that I make changes to. 
    2. raw - this is where the way datasets are stored. It currently contains: 
        - **winequality-red.csv** - data for red wines.
        - **winequality-white.csv** - data for white wines.
        - **winequality.names** - information about the datasets.
